Credit Rating Prediction via Ensemble Learning
📌 Project Overview
This project implements a robust machine learning pipeline to predict credit ratings (or default probability) using Ensemble Learning techniques. By aggregating the predictive power of multiple base learners, the model minimizes variance and bias, providing more reliable risk assessments than single-model approaches.

🚀 Features
Multi-Model Ensemble: Random Forest, XGBoost, 
Imbalance Handling: Utilizes SMOTE to address the class imbalance
Explainable AI (XAI): Integrated SHAP values to provide explaination
